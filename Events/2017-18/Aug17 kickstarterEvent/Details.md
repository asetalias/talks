## Write-Up

Amity University’s Computer Science Department‘s linux club ASET ALiAS organized a “Kickstarter event for the CSE Freshers 2017” on August 21, 2017 from 11.00AM -3.00PM for Fresher Interaction and alumni meet. The event was to introduce them to ALiAS and Free Open Source Software (FOSS), GNU/Linux and spread awareness about the opportunities like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and conferences like PyDelhi, PyData and PyCon India available in the tech industry.

Our Freshers as well as non-freshers were present at the event to seek apt answers to "What to learn", "Where to begin", and much more in this 'Kickstarter Event for Freshers'!

They also got to meet and interact the ALiAS Alumni and other interesting people. Full-stack developers and machine learning experts were invited as speakers.

The speakers made the audience aware of their field of expertise. The audience was enthralled to know about a profession previously unknown to them and many seemed enthusiastic to try them. The audience was also given a getting started guide as a Linux kernel developer by Jatin.
